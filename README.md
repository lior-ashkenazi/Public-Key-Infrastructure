## Public Key Infrastructure Project
This a project I've done in a course named Advanced Topics in Online Privacy and Cybersecurity. This project consists a public key infrastructure (PKI), where the infrastructure is more basic and abstract, strive to imitate a real life PKIs as taught in the course mentioned above. 

In this project, entities can be generated by  a user's commands, with X590 certificates, and communicate with each other (with text messages) all whilst doing so in a secured protocol, as expected in that kind of infrastructure.

## Instructions
For activating the program, please create a python virtual environment in the program’s folder. Then, install the requirements by entering the following command in a terminal open in the project’s folder:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
Thereafter, activate the program by entering the following command:

    python main . py
Then, the program will be activated and the program's instructions will be prompted. Enjoy.
